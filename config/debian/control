Description: Convenience library to aid in porting OpenBSD code - development
 This package contains the libraries, include files, and documentation
 to develop applications with clens.
 clens is a convenience library to aid in porting code from OpenBSD to different
 operating systems. Operating systems traditionally have different enough APIs
 that porting code is painful and can litter pretty code with ugly #ifdef goo.
 In order to keep code readable and drastically reduce the number of #ifdefs
 needed, clens brings other APIs or missing functions into specific OS "focus".
